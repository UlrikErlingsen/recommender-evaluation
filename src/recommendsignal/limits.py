"""Data limits: none on your own computer, hard caps only in a public demo.

Run locally (standalone, a local Signal Hub or an internal company deployment), Recommend Signal imposes no limit
on file size, rows, columns, users or catalog items; the computer's memory and processor are the limit. A public
demo sets ``SIGNAL_PUBLIC=1`` and then every cap below applies, to protect a shared server. Every limit lives in
this module.
